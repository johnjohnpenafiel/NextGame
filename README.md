## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to reinforce and expand my knowledge of React and TypeScript, especially TypeScript, which is relatively new to me. This project also showcases my skills as a Full-Stack Developer, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies.

## API Integration

NextGame fetches data from an external API to provide up-to-date information about games. Ensure that the API key is correctly configured in your environment variables for the app to work correctly.

## Purpose

**JackSpot** was created as the final project of my Flatiron School program, designed to showcase the technical skills and knowledge I gained throughout my journey. The project integrates full-stack development techniques, combining a modern frontend with React and Next.js, and a robust backend with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. JackSpot aims to provide a social, user-friendly platform for discovering and sharing favorite locations, demonstrating the practical application of all the core technologies and concepts learned during my time at Flatiron.
